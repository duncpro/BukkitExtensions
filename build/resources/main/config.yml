# The following value describes the maximum number of positional observations per player which will be
# held at any one time by the "Heading Service". This service allows plugins to access a player's navigational
# heading. Increasing this value will also increase memory usage but will make it possible for plugins
# to more accurately measure a player's heading. This value is measured in time.
# See https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/Duration.html for a list of available units
# and instructions on describing a unit using a string. By default this value is configured to two minutes.
# Therefore two minutes worth of positional history will be available to plugins.
